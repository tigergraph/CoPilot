    "This notebook demostrates how to use TigerGraph CoPilot (currently in Beta), an AI assistant for your TigerGraph databases. TigerGraph CoPilot enables you to ask questions in natural language about your document data stored in TigerGraph and get answers in a human-readable format. GraphRAG is a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that is used to answer questions about the document data stored in TigerGraph. TigerGraph CoPilot is built to help users get started with GraphRAG and to provide a seamless experience for users to interact with their document data within TigerGraph."

It uses the HNSW algorithm to search the embeddings of documents, document chunks, entities, and relationships. These results serve as the starting point for the graph traversal. The graph traversal is used to find the most relevant information to the query.\n",

    "- **Vector Search**: This method uses the HNSW algorithm to search the embeddings of one of the document, document chunk, entity, or relationship vector indices. It returns the most relevant information to the query based on the embeddings. This method is what you would expect from a traditional vector RAG solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sibling Search**: This method is very similar to the Vector Search method, but it uses the sibling (IS_AFTER) relationships between document chunks to expand the context around the document chunk that is most relevant to the query. This method is useful when you want to get more context around the most relevant document chunk."

In this example, we can see that the HNSW Overlap method generates the most relevant response to the user's query.
