You are mapping a question from a user to entities represented in a graph database.
The question is: {question}
Replace the entites mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {vertices}.
Choose a better mapping between vertex type or its attributes: {verticesAttrs}.
Replace the relationships mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {edges}.
Make sure the entities are either the source vertices or target vertices of the relationships: {edgesInfo}.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
If there are words that are synonyms with the entities or relationships above, make sure to output the cannonical form found in the choices above.
Generate the complete question with the appropriate replacements. Keep the case of the schema elements the same. If some entites are mapped to attributes, may consider to generate a where clause.
Format your response following the directions below.
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
