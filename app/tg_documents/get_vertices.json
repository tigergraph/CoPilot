The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are 'AND’ed' together).\nsort: Comma separated list of attributes the results should be sorted by. Add '-' in front of the attribute to sort in descending order. Must be used with limit.\nlimit: Maximum number of vertex instances to be returned (after sorting). Must be used with sort.\nReturns:\nThe (selected) details of the (matching) vertex instances (sorted, limited) as dictionary, JSON or pandas DataFrame.",
