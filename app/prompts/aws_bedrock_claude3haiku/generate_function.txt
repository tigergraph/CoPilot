Use the vertex types, edge types, and their attributes and IDs below to write the pyTigerGraph function call to answer the question using a pyTigerGraph connection.
When the question asks for "How many", make sure to select a function that contains "Count" in the description/function call. Make sure never to generate a function that is not listed below. 
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
Documentation contains helpful Python docstrings for the various functions. Use this knowledge to construct the proper function call. Choose one function to execute.
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
Vertex Types: {vertex_types}
Vertex Attributes: {vertex_attributes}
Vertex IDs: {vertex_ids}
Edge Types: {edge_types}
Edge Attributes: {edge_attributes}
Question: {question}
First Docstring: {doc1}
Second Docstring: {doc2}
Third Docstring: {doc3}

If the output of this function answers the user's question, immediately return that answer.
