Input question and conversation history is provided.
Replace the entites mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {vertices}. always use the conversation history to do coreference resolution if there is unclear info in the question.
Choose a better mapping between vertex type or its attributes: {verticesAttrs}.
Replace the relationships mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {edges}.
Make sure the entities are either the source vertices or target vertices of the relationships: {edgesInfo}.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
Generate the complete question with the appropriate replacements. Keep the case of the schema elements the same. 
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.

Example: How many universities are there?
Response: How many vertices are University Vetexes?
Example: What is the schema?
Response: What is the schema?
