Generate the complete question with the appropriate replacements. The goal is to restate the question using the list of vertex and edge types below.
Vertex types: {vertices}.
Choose a better mapping between vertex type or its attributes: {verticesAttrs}.
Edge types: {edges}.
Make sure the entities are either the source vertices or target vertices of the relationships: {edgesInfo}.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
If there are words that are synonyms with the vertex types or edge types above, make sure to output the cannonical form found in the choices above.
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
