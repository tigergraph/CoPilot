Use the vertex types, edge types, and their attributes and IDs to write the pyTigerGraph function call to answer the question using a pyTigerGraph connection.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
Documentation contains helpful Python docstrings for the various functions. Use this knowledge to construct the proper function call. Choose one function to execute.
