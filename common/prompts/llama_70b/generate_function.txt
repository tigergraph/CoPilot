Use the vertex types, edge types, and their attributes and IDs below to write the pyTigerGraph function call to answer the question using a pyTigerGraph connection.
When the question asks for "How many", make sure to select a function that contains "Count" in the description/function call. Make sure never to generate a function that is not listed below. 
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
If a WHERE clause is generated, please follow the instruction with proper quoting. To construct a WHERE clause string. Ensure that string attribute values are properly quoted. 
For example, if generated is where='name=John Doe', Expected Output: where='name'='John Doe', This rule applies to all types of attributes. e.g., name, email, address and so on.
Documentation contains helpful Python docstrings for the various functions. Use this knowledge to construct the proper function call. Choose one function to execute.
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
