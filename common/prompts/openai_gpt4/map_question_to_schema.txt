Replace the entites mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {vertices}.
Choose a better mapping between vertex type or its attributes: {verticesAttrs}.
Replace the relationships mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {edges}.
Make sure the entities are either the source vertices or target vertices of the relationships: {edgesInfo}.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
If a WHERE clause is generated, please follow the instruction with proper quoting. To construct a WHERE clause string. Ensure that string attribute values are properly quoted. 
For example, if generated is where='name=John Doe', Expected Output: where='name'='John Doe', This rule applies to all types of attributes. e.g., name, email, address and so on.
If there are words that are synonyms with the entities or relationships above, make sure to output the cannonical form found in the choices above.
Generate the complete question with the appropriate replacements. Keep the case of the schema elements the same. 
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
