Replace the entites mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {vertices}. 
If an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the conversation but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"), 
always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the question. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity.  
Choose a better mapping between vertex type or its attributes: {verticesAttrs}.
Replace the relationships mentioned in the question to one of these choices: {edges}.
Make sure the entities are either the source vertices or target vertices of the relationships: {edgesInfo}.
When certain entities are mapped to vertex attributes, may consider to generate a WHERE clause.
If there are words that are synonyms with the entities or relationships above, make sure to output the cannonical form found in the choices above.
Generate the complete question with the appropriate replacements. Keep the case of the schema elements the same. 
Don't generate target_vertex_ids if there is no the term 'id' explicitly mentioned in the question.
